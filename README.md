# Space Invaders University Project

This project is a university assignment developed using Pygame, inspired by the classic arcade game "Space Invaders". The game features a spaceship that the player controls to avoid and shoot down incoming aliens. The game incorporates various sound effects and music, and it tracks the player's score against a high score that persists across sessions.

## Installation

Before running the game, ensure you have Python and Pygame installed. You can install Pygame via pip:

pip install pygame

Game Features

    Scoring System: Players earn points by destroying aliens and lose points when hit by alien fire.
    Health and Explosions: The spaceship has health points; receiving hits from enemies will reduce health and eventually destroy the spaceship, accompanied by an explosion animation.
    Persistent High Score: Scores are tracked during the game and saved to a file, so the high score persists across game sessions.
